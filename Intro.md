Mathematics is about structure, about reasoning, and about modeling. 
This course braids these three threads together.  Mathematical logic
began as the study of the reasoning used in mathematics, but it turns
out to be useful in describing the mathematical concept of structure and
in modeling automated reasoning—that is, modeling computation. The
logical approach to structure gives an alternate perspective on such
other mathematical subjects as combinatorics and abstract algebra. 
This, for the most part, is described by the area of model theory, which
is the focus of Unit 1. In Unit 2, we will look at modeling
computation.  The central fact of these models, from a logical
standpoint, is that once we can handle a computation as a definable
mathematical object, we can prove that certain computations are
impossible.  The most famous such proof is Gödel’s Incompleteness
Theorem, showing that it is impossible to compute truth in a system
sufficiently strong to describe natural number arithmetic. Finally, in
Unit 3, we turn to proof theory.  Just as modeling computations results
in new insights, modeling the process of mathematical proof results in a
surprising connection: a proof is analogous to a computation. These
three often interact.  Proofs and computations have natural parallels
with the language we use to describe structures.  Structures from model
theory give natural settings for computation, as in Gödel’s
Incompleteness Theorem.  After completing this course, you will
understand all three.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

-   Prove categoricity of a first-order theory in simple examples.
-   Distinguish elementary and non-elementary properties.
-   Describe mathematical models of computation and their respective
    limitations.
-   Use the coding of computations by natural numbers to construct
    examples and proofs of impossibility.
-   Explain the Curry-Howard analogy between proofs and computations.

### Course Requirements

In order to take this course you must:  
  
 √    Have access to a computer.  
  
 √    Have continuous broadband Internet access.  
  
 √    Have the ability/permission to install plug-ins or software (e.g.,
Adobe Reader or Flash).  
  
 √    Have the ability to download and save files and documents to a
computer.  
  
 √    Have the ability to open Microsoft files and documents (.doc,
.ppt, .xls, etc.).  
  
 √    Be competent in the English language.  
  
 √    Have read the [Saylor Student
Handbook](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Saylor-StudentHandbook.pdf).  
  
 √    Be comfortable with mathematical proofs like those you might see
in [MA231: Abstract Algebra I](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma231/) or
[MA241: Real Analysis I](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma241/).  
  
 *Note: Familiarity with the key examples of
[MA231](http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma231/), while not strictly
necessary, will be helpful in Unit 1.*
