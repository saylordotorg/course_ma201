**Unit 3: Proof Theory** <span id="3"></span> 
*Proofs, in the context of mathematical logic, have a combinatorial
structure of their own.  One can think of proofs as algebraic objects
generated by a set of derivation rules.  These derivation rules turn out
to bear a striking resemblance – strong enough to often be called an
“isomorphism” – to the rules for defining a function in the simply-typed
lambda calculus.  Because this analogy is so useful in the design of
programming languages and in verification of software, we will take a
deeper look at the lambda calculus with a view toward this
“isomorphism,” which describes the sense in which logic is a model for
these parts of software engineering.  
  
 An important point is that the logic corresponding to computation by
this isomorphism is something less than classical logic.  It is a
fragment of logic called “intuitionistic logic,” formerly used by people
with philosophical misgivings about foundational questions in
mathematics.  It does not include proof by contradiction, for
instance.  
  
 Questions to keep in mind: Is it intuitively believable that all
computation could be expressed as proof rules?  What are the key
differences between classical and intuitionistic logic?  What might a
Curry-Howard isomorphism for classical logic look like?*

-   **Reading: Dalhousie University: Peter Selinger’s Lecture Notes on
    the Lambda Calculus: “Section 2.1”**
    Link: Dalhousie University: Peter Selinger’s *Lecture Notes on the
    Lambda Calculus*: [“Section
    2.1”](http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/) (PDF or PS)  
      
     Instructions: Near the bottom of the page, find the section
    entitled, “Lecture Notes on the Lambda Calculus,” and click on the
    link to any convenient format of the document.  Read section 2.1,
    and solve Exercise 3.  We saw the lambda calculus before as a way of
    encoding computation.  In this unit, it will be developed, with some
    new features, into a programming language that mirrors what we do
    when we prove theorems in a formal system. After you have attempted
    the exercise, you may check your answers against the Saylor
    Foundation’s [“Subunit 3.1.1
    Solutions”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MA201-Solutions-3.1.1.pdf)
    (PDF).

     Instructions: Near the bottom of the page, find the section
    entitled, “Lecture Notes on the Lambda Calculus,” and click on the
    link to any convenient format of the document.  Read sections 2.2 to
    2.5.  The bookkeeping is the central feature of these sections – and
    the introduction of the notation for proof rules in the tables.
     This notation takes some getting used to, but will eventually be
    important.  The idea is that if the conditions above the line are
    known, one can conclude the condition below the line.

    link to any convenient format of the document.  Read from the
    beginning of Chapter 3 through the end of section 3.1, solving
    Exercise 5.  To be able to do logic, we should at least be able to
    handle notions of true and false.  This section shows that the
    lambda calculus is strong enough to handle such things. After you
    have attempted the exercise, you may check your answers against the
    Saylor Foundation’s [“Subunit 3.1.3

    entitled, “Lecture Notes on the Lambda Calculus,” and click on the
    link to any convenient format of the document.  Read section 3.2,
    solving Exercises 6 and 7.  Another standard benchmark of being able
    to say interesting things is that one should be able to talk about
    the truth of obviously true statements of arithmetic.  Here we see
    that the lambda calculus admits that, too. After you have attempted
    the exercise, you may check your answers against the Saylor
    Foundation’s [“Subunit 3.1.4

    link to any convenient format of the document.  Read section 3.3,
    solving Exercises 8, 9, 10, and 11.  Fixed points (or “fixpoints”)
    are a subtle feature in programming language semantics.  You may
    need to reread this section, but in any case, if you skip any
    exercises, don’t skip these. After you have attempted the exercise,
    you may check your answers against the Saylor Foundation’s [“Subunit

     Instructions: Near the bottom of the page, find the section
    entitled, “Lecture Notes on the Lambda Calculus,” and click on the
    link to any convenient format of the document.  Read section 3.4,
    and solve one of the three problems in Exercise 12.  We have seen,
    in the earlier proof of the Gödel Incompleteness Theorems, that if
    you can encode strings of natural numbers, you can express anything.
     This section shows that the reasoning system of the lambda calculus
    is as broad as could reasonably be expected. After you have
    attempted the exercise, you may check your answers against the
    Saylor Foundation’s [“Subunit 3.1.6

    link to any convenient format of the document.  Read from the
    beginning of Chapter 4 through the end of section 4.2.  The
    Church-Rosser Theorem is useful for proving consistency, and for
    other things, but the right way to think of this section for the
    purposes of this course is that it gives you a real (and hard) proof
    on which to try out your understanding of the definitions.

    goal is that you check your understanding of the definitions.  Look
    up anything from the previous work that you don’t understand. After
    you have attempted the exercise, you may check your answers against

    yet seen anything that is transparently a proof system.  Have
    patience, though.  What we are doing is a proof system in disguise.
     For the moment, the overt goal is to produce a structure (more or
    less in the sense of model theory) satisfying the formulas written
    in the previous two subunits.

    entitled, “Lecture Notes on the Lambda Calculus,” and click on the
    link to any convenient format of the document.  Read section 5.3,
    solving Exercise 20.  Just as regular expressions gave an algebraic
    understanding of automata, combinatory algebras give an algebraic
    understanding of the lambda calculus.  Of course, we expect the
    algebra here to be much more complicated. After you have attempted
    the exercise, you may check your answers against the Saylor

    mistakes.  If a program expects a number and gets a function or an
    ordered pair instead, we’d like for it to recognize that something
    is wrong.  That feature is what is being reflected in the typing

    Lambda Calculus*: [“Section
    6.11”](http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/) (PDF or PS)  
      
     Instructions: Near the bottom of the page, find the section
    entitled, “Lecture Notes on the Lambda Calculus,” and click on the
    link to any convenient format of the document.  Read section 6.11,
    solving Exercise 32.  Assuming that we have gotten past the
    philosophical debates of the early twentieth century, the
    Curry-Howard isomorphism is really intuitionistic logic’s reason to
    exist.  The people who, in their serious practical thinking, deny
    classical logic are rare. After you have attempted the exercise, you
    may check your answers against the Saylor Foundation’s [“Subunit
    3.4.7
    Solutions”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MA201-Solutions-3.4.7.pdf)

-   **Reading: Dalhousie University: Peter Selinger’s Lecture Notes on
    the Lambda Calculus: “Section 6.12”**
    Link: Dalhousie University: Peter Selinger’s *Lecture Notes on the
    Lambda Calculus*: [“Section
    6.12”](http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/)  (PDF or PS)  
      
     Instructions: Near the bottom of the page, find the section
    entitled, “Lecture Notes on the Lambda Calculus,” and click on the
    link to any convenient format of the document.  Read section 6.12.
     If everybody thinks in classical logic, and the Curry-Howard
    isomorphism says that simply-typed lambda calculus corresponds to
    programming in intuitionistic logic, this section gives a start on
    thinking about what programming in classical logic might look
    like.
